# Hi, I'm Joe 👋 👨‍💻


I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source data more accessible, and creating technology that will help people around the world. Some technologies I enjoy working with include React, Angular, API's and Sass. I recently graduated from the nology bootcamp in London 🧑‍🎓 <br />
My interest in the React ecosystem has led me to be currently searching for React-based roles around the world!
